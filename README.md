# About this Project
This repository contains [raw data](https://github.com/aaliyah808/Streaming-Database_Team3/blob/main/rawValues), [SQL code](https://github.com/aaliyah808/Streaming-Database_Team3/tree/cfb552d463f1724d5f0812f4a088f086c4ecfc8f/code), crow's foot ERD, and Tableau visualizations from a database project developed for LIS 543, Relational Database Management Systems, taught by Simon W. Wang at the University of Washington iSchool in the Winter 2024 quarter. Aaliyah Davis, Yawen Guo, Gigi Shannon, and Xinya Tang contributed to the development of this database for a music streaming service. The purpose of this database is to maintain a music distribution and streaming platform’s data on the production and upload of digital audio files; users’ interaction, purchase, and downloading of digital audio files; and record engagement among users. The database keeps the purchase, download, like, and listen history of users and the accumulated income of labels. Data records related to social features and digital files are available to all users and labels who release music. Sensitive information related to invoice numbers in purchasing history and account registration is private to the users themselves. The labels who receive payment for transactions have access to purchase and sales data. Further information about the database purpose, business rules, and entities can be found in the [design statement](https://github.com/aaliyah808/Streaming-Database_Team3/blob/main/designDocumentation/README.md#database-design-statement).
