Number,Entity Name,Rationale,Relationship with other entities
1,User,"A major objective of the database is to track interaction among users and digital audio files, i.e. the product (track and album). In order to do that, users have to be searchable by their unique user_ID. Other important attributes of the user entity are aspects of their public profile including username, register date, profile photo, and profile description, as well as the user account management data including email, phone number, password, and last login date.",
"As a core entity, the primary key, user_ID, is related to ListenHistory, PurchaseHistory, LikeHistory, DownloadHistory, Playlist, MusicianActivity, and MusicianSpecialty. As there are many-to-many relationships between User and Track entities, several associative entities are created."
2,FollowingRelationship,"This entity is designed to track a user's engagement with other users, i.e. to track who a user is following as well as who is following that user.","This entity is relatively special since it has two foreign keys that point to the same primary key user_ID in the User entity."
3,PurchaseHistory,"Facilitating the purchasing of digital media files is a business objective. Users and labels can track the purchase activities using this entity, which tracks data about what product was purchased, when it was purchased, and at what price, as well as a unique invoice number. This allows users to keep track of their purchases and enables labels to track their sales. Users can only purchase one product at a time. Only the buyer and seller can see the purchase data. Labels can see data about what was purchased, who purchased it, and the date of purchase.","This entity is substantial for tracking purchases and income for users and labels, respectively. The primary key is invoice_num. The foreign keys user_id and product_id relate this entity to User and Product."
4,LikeHistory,"Like feature is one of the important methods to facilitate users’ interactions and track users’ music tastes. Analyzing the data in LikeHistory would help the application learn about users and recommend similar music to them.","This entity is an associative entity, as it takes the primary key from two strong entities User and Track respectively, to form a composite primary key." 
5,DownloadHistory,"This entity captures the tracks the users download and those tracks must be purchased before downloading. However, the download date doesn't have to be the same as the purchase time. Users can download a track multiple times after they have purchased it. Download feature allow users to enjoy music offline.","This entity is an associative entity, as it takes the primary key from two strong entities User and Track respectively, to form a composite primary key." 
6,ListenHistory,"This entity preserves the data of what music users listen to. Users can check the history unrestrictedly. This entity provides a wider view of users’ inclination to music compared to LikeHistory. These two entities collaboratively play roles in predicting users’ listening habits and can aid in personalized marketing in order to suggest similar artists and allow labels and musicians to track consumer demographics.","This entity is an associative entity, as it takes the primary key from two strong entities User and Track respectively, to form a composite primary key."
7,MusicianActivity,"A main objective of this database is to demonstrate the contributors of each track. In order to connect the two most important entities User and Track in this database, and to settle the many-to-many relationship between these two entities, the MusicianActivity is introduced. It is an associative entity with a composite primary key, including the user_ID, track_ID, and speciality_ID.","This entity is an associative entity, as it takes the primary key from three strong entities User, Track, and MusicianSpeciality respectively, to form a composite primary key." 
8,MusicianSpeciality,"An objective of this database is to demonstrate how the contributors contribute to each track and in what way. The entity of MusicianSpeciality is such an “inventory” of musician activities, describing different roles or function such as song composition, lyric composition, arrangement, etc. It has speciality_ID as the primary key, and another attribute of speciality_desc.","This entity is the third parent entity of MusicianActivity as described above. Its primary key speciality_ID is one of the primary keys of MusicianActivity entity."
9,Product,"A main objective of our database is to collect information on the purchase of music made by users. Product is a superclass of Album and Track because those are the two kinds of music products a user may create or purchase. The product’s price is indicated in this entity.","Product Entity’s primary key relates to purchase history so that insights may be made about purchases users are making."
10,Track,"One of the main objectives of our database is to collect information on individual songs and information related to their creation and audience listening habits. The track’s name, run time, release date, beats per minute, sale price are indicated in this entity.","Track entity is a subclass of Product Entity because it is a kind of product a user may create or purchase. As one of the core entities of this database, the primary key track_ID is related to LikeHistory, DownloadHistory, ListenHistory, and MusicanActivity so that insight may be gained about these entities in relation to Track. Track entity is related to Genre entity to indicate what genre would describe the music. Track entity is related to Playlist entity through an associative entity due to its many-to-many relationship. A playlist can have more than one track on it and a track can be on more than one playlist. Track entity is related to Album entity to indicate what album it was released on." 
11,Album,"Another main objective of this database is to collect information on music sales. Because users can purchase music in the form of an album that consists of possibly multiple tracks, we collect information on albums using this entity.","Album is a subclass of product because it is a kind of product a user may purchase. Album entity is related to track through its primary key, album_ID, so that insight may be gained about tracks and albums." 
12,Label,"One of the main objectives of this database is to collect information on music sales. Because the music labels are the sellers in these transactions, we collect information on labels through this entity.","Label is related to Product and PurchaseHistory through its primary key, label_ID, so that insight may be gained about these entities in relation to Label. Product is related to Label to indicate which label a product was produced by and disseminated under."
13,Playlist,"This entity enables users to collect multiple tracks together at their own discretion. Users can create playlists using any track regardless of if they have purchased it. Labels and users can track data on their tracks used in playlists created by other users.","Playlist is related to User through the foreign key user_ID and also related to Track through the associative entity PlaylistInclusiveness."
14,PlaylistInclusiveness,"This associative entity exists to comply with the business rules of track instance per playlist. Each instance of a track in a playlist is recorded through this entity so duplicate tracks will not appear on a playlist and to show each playlist that a track is a part of.","PlaylistInclusiveness is related to Track and Playlist through a composite key created by track_ID and playlist_ID."
